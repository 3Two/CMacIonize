Lexington HII 20 benchmark

This benchmark consists of uniform box with density 100 cm^-3, with a small
spherical region with radius 3.e18 cm and density 0 cut out of the centre.
In the centre of this cavity is a luminous blackbody source at temperature
2.e4 K. The radiation of the central source will ionize a spherical region in
the high density part of the box, wherein different ions will have different
ionic fraction profiles. The radius of this spherical region is about 5. pc, so
we enclose the whole system in a box of 10. x 10. x 10. pc.

The abundances of the elements inside the region are:
 - helium: 0.1
 - carbon: 2.2e-4
 - nitrogen: 4.e-5
 - oxygen: 3.3e-4
 - neon: 5.e-5
 - sulphur: 9.e-6
