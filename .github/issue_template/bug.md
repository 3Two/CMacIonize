## Bug description

This is where you should describe the bug: what happens to the code? What error output do you get? What output do you get when you configure with `-DACTIVATE_ASSERTIONS=True`?

## Minimal example of bug

This is where you should include all information needed to reproduce the bug (if possible): a parameter file and additional input files (if they can be included as text). If you can link to additional resources, that can also help.

## System information

Please add relevant information about your system here, such as operating system name, compiler name, code configuration...
