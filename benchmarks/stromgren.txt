Stromgren benchmark

This benchmark consists of a homogeneous density field with a single stellar
source at the centre. The radiation from the star will ionize a spherical
region surrounding the star, the size of which can be analytically found.

The actual size of the ionized region in the simulation results will be slightly
larger than the analytical value due to the diffuse field (which is ingored in
the analytic derivation).

The test can be run using the provided parameter file (stromgren.param). To
analyze the results, use the Python script (stromgren.py).
