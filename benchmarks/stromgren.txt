Stromgren benchmark

This benchmark consists of a homogeneous density field with a single stellar
source at the centre. The radiation from the star will ionize a spherical
region surrounding the star, the size of which can be analytically found.

Once this benchmark actually works, I will add a Python script that analyzes
the results and tells us if the test succeeded or not.
